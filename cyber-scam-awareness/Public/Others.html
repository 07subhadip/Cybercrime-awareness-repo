                Deepfake technology, which uses artificial intelligence to create realistic but fabricated videos or audio, has become a growing concern in today's digital world. While originally developed for entertainment and creative purposes, it is increasingly being used to manipulate information, deceive individuals, and spread misinformation. Deepfakes can distort reality by making it appear as though someone said or did something they never did, posing significant risks to privacy, public trust, and even democracy. Raising awareness about deepfakes is essential, as it equips people with the knowledge to recognize manipulated content and critically assess the authenticity of online media. Staying informed, questioning suspicious videos, and using tools to detect deepfakes are key steps in safeguarding against this technology's misuse.

Raising awareness about cryptocurrency crime is crucial to help individuals and organizations safeguard their digital assets.
